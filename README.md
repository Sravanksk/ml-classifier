Instructions :: 

1. This project is the simple Text Classifier Model build with  " Naive Bayes Classifier " with the help of Keras Library.

**I have used Keras to build this model, as it handles all the complexity behind building Machine Learning Models and gives us a clean code when building ML models
	
2. This Model will predict the Category of the given input into 'Politics' or 'Sports'

3. Based on the input given in the given HTML form you will get the output saying that "The input you have entered is related to Sports / Politics "
